# Word_Embeddings

This is a personal project from DeepLearning.AI's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/) Course#5: Sequence Models

This repository uses word embeddings to understand how networks capture relationships between words using cosine similarity to solve analogy problems.
